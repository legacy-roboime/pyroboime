class Transmitter(object):
    '''
    Base 'interface' that describes the desired methods for a
    transmitter to be used in our TxCommander. The different
    classes for transmitter manipulation should implement these
    to allow for easy hot-swapping of different transmission modules
    while we do not settle on a new solution.
